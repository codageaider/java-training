Given an array of students with marks. The array is sorted initially based on name;
A shift operation is applied to this array so
if the array students=[student1,student2,student3]
After a single shift operation the array become [student3, student1, student2]
After one more shift operation the array becomes [student2,student2,student1]

Suppose several shift operations are applied to the given array with is sorted by name.
Now given a name you have to find the marks of this student.

Find the Time Complexity of your solution.
Try to optimize the solution
