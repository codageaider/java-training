All the code files are part of the application. But the properties files can
be moved out of the code. And you can make any changes to properties file
without effecting code.

property value is getting initialized properly


Ex:
(i) Declare a local exception and try throwing it from a different controller and
post the results
(ii) Then make the exception global and post the resutls
